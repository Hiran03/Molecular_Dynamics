# Molecular Dynamics Simulation for Tensile Test of Polymers 

Molecular Dynamics (MD) is a computational simulation technique employed in various scientific disciplines to investigate the behaviour and properties of molecular systems at the atomic level. Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations function by numerically integrating Newton's equations of motion to predict the time evolution of a molecular system. At the core of MD lies the principle that the behaviour of a system can be determined by tracking the positions and velocities of its constituent atoms or molecules over time. 

Our objective encompasses conducting a tensile test under a constant strain rate through molecular dynamics simulation using LAMMPS, generating stress-strain plots for hydrated PVA.
